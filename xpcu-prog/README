xpcu-prog - An (X)SVF player for the Xilinx Platform Cable USB
==============================================================

  **WARNING: This is work under construction!**

This work is inspired on XUP-0.0.2 (http://inisyn.org/src/xup/) by inisyn
research.  The only code left in this project that comes from XUP is the XSVF
file for the CPLD in the Xilinx Platform Cable USB.


Building and Installing
-----------------------

1. Install required libraries and tools

	You need GNU make, GCC, libusb and sdcc

2. Build libxsvf.a

	$ make -C .. libxsvf.a

3. Build xpcu-prog

	$ make

4. Install xpcu-prog

	$ sudo cp xpcu-prog /usr/local/bin/


Using
-----

1. Program the CPLD

	When using xpcu-prog the first time with a cable you need to program
	the CPLD in the cable:

		$ xpcu-prog -X

	This step needs to be repeated whenever a new probe is used or another
	program (such as iMPACT) was used with the cable since the last time
	"xpcu-prog -X" was performed on the cable.

2. Use it

	Perfroming a bus scan:

		$ xpcu-prog -c

	Playing an SVF file:

		$ xpcu-prog -s svf_file_name

	Playing an XSVF file:

		$ xpcu-prog -x xsvf_file_name
