xsvftool-xpcu - An (X)SVF player for the Xilinx Platform Cable USB
==================================================================

This program can be used to play SVF and XSVF files on the "Xilinx
Platform Cable USB" family of JTAG probes.

It is based on the libxsvf library:
http://www.clifford.at/libxsvf/

This tool replaces the original CPLD firmware from Xilinx when run
on one of the probes. However: The Xilinx tools (i.e. impact) programs
the CPLD again with the Xilinx firmware whenever needed. So there is
not problem with that.

The file 'firmware.c' also contains a brief description of the pin mappings
between the the Cypress CY7C68013A-100AIX and the Xilinx XC2C256-7VQ100
on the probe as used by this software, as well as a brief description of
the USB protocol this software is using.

With this software it is possible to use JTAG clock speeds up to 24 MHz.
But with the high frequencies there are "gaps" in the transmittion resulting
in an effective transfer rate of approx 6 MBit/s.

This tool contains firmware for the CY7C68013A-100AIX (firmware.c) and for the
XC2C256-7VQ100 (hardware.v) on the probe. Some more exotic tools are needed to
build these. So pre-compiled versions of this firmware images are distributed
along with the xsvftool-xpcu sourcecode. You need to set the USE_PREP_* config
options in the Makefile to '0' if you prefer building the firmware yourself.
